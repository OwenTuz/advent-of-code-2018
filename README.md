# Advent of Code 2018 (Rust)
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) in Rust.

This is basically for my own benefit as I teach myself Rust.

Solutions are optimised for 'gives the right answer' and may not be particularly fast or idiomatic. There is no error handling. Don't run this code in production!

### Howto

```
cargo run --bin day1
```
You can also run unit tests:
```
cargo test
cargo test --bin day1
```
